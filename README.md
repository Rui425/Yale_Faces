# Yale_Faces
Load and reconstract the pictures we want
## Project summary 
We are going to load the data from the Yale Faces B data set, which is in the Files and Resources tab of Courseworks. These are .pgm images, which are viewable either through R or with a specialized viewer like Gimp. There are 38 subjects (labeled 1 to 39 with no 14), each photographed in a variety of lighting conditions. The file name denotes the data set, the subject, and the lighting condition. We will look at three lighting conditions, P00A-005E+10, P00A-005E-10, and P00A-010E+00, which are closest to straight on lighting. We will use the pixmap library to manipulate the data. Load this library and make sure that the folder YaleCropped is in your working directory
